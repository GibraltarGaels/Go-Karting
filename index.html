  <h1>Pricewise: Will Peters' Stag Go-Karting Classic</h1>

  <p><strong>By Tom Segal (sort of)</strong></p>

  <p>As anticipation builds for what’s being dubbed the <em>“Monaco of the Midlands”</em>, the <strong>Will Peters Stag Go-Karting Grand Prix</strong> promises thrills, spills, and almost certainly some kind of post-race pint-based protest. Six names dominate the early chatter – five confirmed starters and one intriguing wildcard – but only one will take the chequered flag.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🧼</span>Joel Orme</h2>
  <p class="odds">Odds: 4/1</p>
  <p>Smooth operator. Known for his clean lines and economy of motion, Joel brings a "budget Lewis Hamilton" vibe — although whispers from the paddock suggest his real inspiration wears black and white and plays at St James' Park. With Newcastle United's highs and lows coursing through his veins, he’ll be desperate to avoid his own Magpies-style meltdown late on.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Likely to lead early. Vulnerable late.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">👑</span>Will Peters (The Stag)</h2>
  <p class="odds">Odds: 5/1</p>
  <p>The stag. The main character. Also a massive Wigan fan, which tells you all you need to know about his decision-making under pressure. More interested in the banter and the beers than the podium, Will’s racecraft is... enthusiastic, let’s say. If style points were awarded for cornering with one hand and waving with the other, he’d be odds-on.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Icon of the day — but leave him out of your tricast.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🚀</span>Emmett Leavy</h2>
  <p class="odds">Odds: 4/6</p>
  <p>Fast, fearless, and Irish — Emmett’s racing style screams chaos. With his own wedding looming just six days later, there’s every chance he races like a man with nothing left to lose. Expect bold overtakes, dramatic exits, and the occasional celebratory fist pump. If he finishes, he wins. If he doesn’t, the photos will still be iconic.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: High risk, high reward.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">💪</span>Sam Thompson</h2>
  <p class="odds">Odds: 2/1</p>
  <p>The great unknown. Will’s cousin enters the fray with little fanfare but high expectations. There are rumours of karting pedigree, and rumours of absolutely nothing — which makes pricing him a nightmare. Could be a dark horse or just a guy with gloves.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Danger to all, but possibly flammable under pressure.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🧠</span>Shane Callaghan</h2>
  <p class="odds">Odds: 3/1</p>
  <p>The current Gibraltar Chairman and easily the loudest man in the paddock, Shane blends brute volume with calculated aggression. He’s following directly in the footsteps of his hero and predecessor Will Peters — first taking the GAA reins, now chasing stag glory. Loud, proud, and deceptively sharp behind the wheel, Shane could talk his rivals off the track.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Big personality, bigger ambitions. Major player.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🕶</span>Michael Stephen Charge (TBC)</h2>
  <p class="odds">Odds: 20/1 (if declared)</p>
  <p>Unconfirmed, but the paddock is buzzing. A sports fanatic with a love for cricket, horse racing and Cambridge United (yes, really), Charge is a tactical thinker who might just outwit the lot of them. If he shows, expect street smarts, steady laps, and a well-timed lunge or two.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Market mover if entered.</p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🏁</span>Pricewise Verdict</h2>
  <p>It’s a wide-open race, but value lies with <strong>Shane Callaghan at 3/1</strong>, who combines legacy, volume, and actual talent in one chaotic package. For the brave punter, <strong>Emmett Leavy</strong> is a wildcard with rocket fuel — just don’t expect a refund.</p>

  <p>Watch for late money on <strong>Michael Stephen Charge</strong> — if confirmed, he could throw a spanner in everyone’s strategy.</p>

  <p><strong>Recommended Bet:</strong> Shane Callaghan – 1pt win @ 3/1<br />
  <strong>Wildcard Bet:</strong> Michael Stephen Charge – 0.5pt EW @ 20/1 (if declared)</p>
