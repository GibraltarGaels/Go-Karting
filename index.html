  <h1>Pricewise: Will Peters' Stag Go-Karting Classic</h1>

  <p><strong>By Tom Segal (sort of)</strong></p>

  <p>As anticipation builds for what’s being dubbed the “Monaco of the Midlands”, the Will Peters Stag Go-Karting Grand Prix promises thrills, spills, and almost certainly some kind of post-race pint-based protest. Six names dominate the early chatter – well, five confirmed starters and one intriguing wildcard – but only one will take the chequered flag.</p>

  <p>Let’s take a closer look at the runners and make a case for the value in this hotly-contested stag stakes.</p>

  <h2>🧼 Joel Orme <span class="odds">(5/2)</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Profile:</strong> Smooth operator. Known for his clean lines and economy of motion, Joel has that “Lewis Hamilton on a budget” vibe. He’s the obvious front-runner and the bookies’ favourite — but that short price makes him poor value in a race full of variables (namely beer, bravado, and brake abuse).</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Likely to lead early. Vulnerable late.</p>

  <h2>🚀 Emmett Leavy <span class="odds">(4/1)</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Profile:</strong> Raw pace, unpredictable temperament. Think Jacques Villeneuve with less hair and more hangovers. If Emmett stays on track (literally and emotionally), he could blitz the field. But past form suggests he’s equally likely to bin it on lap 2 while attempting a risky overtake on a hairpin.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: High risk, high reward.</p>

  <h2>🧠 Shane Callaghan <span class="odds">(11/4)</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Profile:</strong> The thinking man’s driver. Shane combines strategic nous with sneaky competitiveness – he’ll lull you into a false sense of security before divebombing you in the final laps. Not flashy, but frighteningly efficient.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Solid each-way value. Definitely in the mix.</p>

  <h2>👑 Will Peters (The Stag) <span class="odds">(12/1)</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Profile:</strong> The man of the moment. Expect him to be distracted by inflatable props, mid-race shoeys, or the weight of his own crown. His focus will be on vibes, not victory. Could mount a surprise charge if the others forget he’s even racing.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Not today, Your Majesty.</p>

  <h2>💪 Sam Thompson <span class="odds">(7/2)</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Profile:</strong> Rumoured to be bringing his own gloves, which suggests commitment. Strong upper body and decent sporting pedigree, but stamina over a full karting session is questionable. Could fade if the track has an incline or if someone cuts off his line one too many times.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Danger to all, but possibly flammable under pressure.</p>

  <h2>🕶 Michael Stephen Charge (TBC) <span class="odds">(20/1 if declared)</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Profile:</strong> Not yet confirmed, but whispers from the paddock suggest Charge may be supplemented late. If he shows up, don’t sleep on him — experience and street smarts could see him pick off slower rivals. His name alone is worth a fiver each-way.</p>
  <p class="verdict">Verdict: Market mover if entered.</p>

  <h2>🏆 Pricewise Verdict</h2>
  <p>It’s a wide-open race, but value lies with Shane Callaghan at 11/4, who combines consistency and cunning in equal measure. Emmett Leavy appeals to the brave, and if you’re chasing fireworks, he’s your man.</p>
  <p>Watch for late market moves on Michael Stephen Charge — if he’s confirmed, expect a plunge.</p>
  <p><strong>Recommended Bet:</strong> Shane Callaghan – 1pt win @ 11/4<br />
     <strong>Wildcard Bet:</strong> Michael Stephen Charge – 0.5pt EW @ 20/1 (if declared)</p>
